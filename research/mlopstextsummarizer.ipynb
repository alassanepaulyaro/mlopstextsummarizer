    "### Purpose of accelerate:\n",
    "1. Ease of Multi-Device Training: Whether you're using multiple GPUs or TPUs, accelerate makes it easier to scale your model across devices with minimal code changes.\n",
    "2. Mixed Precision: It allows models to be trained using mixed precision, which can speed up training and reduce memory usage.\n",
    "3. Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO): Helps manage large models by efficiently splitting the model across multiple devices.\n",
    "Offload to CPU/SSD: Useful for large models that may not fit entirely into GPU memory, by allowing parts of the model or optimizer to be offloaded to CPU or even SSD.\n"

    "1. Scores close to 1: This indicates a strong overlap between the generated summary and the reference summary, which is desirable in summarization tasks. For example, an F1-score of 0.7 or higher across metrics is generally considered good.\n",
    "2. Scores between 0.5 and 0.7: Indicates moderate overlap. The summary might be capturing key points but is likely missing some structure or important information.\n",
